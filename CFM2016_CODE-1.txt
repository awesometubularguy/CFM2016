It was so shocking, in fact, that, upon hearing the news, Hillary Clinton, the already confirmed Democratic nominee, fainted. While doctors confirmed it was nothing too serious, they were strongly opposed to her running a full political campaign. The next few days at the DNC were total chaos. Desks were flipped, chairs were hurled, Sander's phone calls were ignored, and an air of doom and gloom lingered around the cold rooms of the committe. That is until <strong>he</strong> showed up, sporting a cowboy hat, an American flag-colored medieval armor, luscious beard and hair, and a scent of weed and honey. His name was Cheeseburger Freedom Man, but they would come to know him as their last chance.</p>",
